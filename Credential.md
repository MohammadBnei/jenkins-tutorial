In Jenkins, credentials are used to securely store secrets, such as passwords, private keys, or API tokens, and make them available to build jobs without exposing them in the configuration files or source code. Jenkins credentials can be managed at different scopes within the system, such as global scope (available to all jobs) or within specific folders or jobs.

### Adding Credentials in Jenkins

Conceptually, to add credentials in Jenkins, follow these general steps:

1. **Access Credential Store**: 
   - Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Go to 'Manage Jenkins' > 'Manage Credentials'.

2. **Select Scope**:
   - Choose the domain within which to add the credentials (typically 'Global credentials').

3. **Add a New Credential**:
   - Click 'Add Credentials' on the left side.
   - Select the kind of credential you want to add (e.g., username with password, secret text, SSH key, API token).

4. **Input Credential Details**:
   - Fill in required fields such as:
     - **ID**: An identifier for the credentials. This can be autogenerated or defined by you.
     - **Description**: A human-readable description of what the credential is used for.
     - **The Secret**: The actual credential, such as the password or token.

5. **Save the Credential**:
   - After providing all necessary information, save the credential.

### Using Credentials in Jenkins

Once the credentials are stored in Jenkins, they can be used in several ways, most commonly in build jobs via Jenkinsfiles or job configurations.

1. **In Jenkinsfile**:
   - Credentials added to Jenkins can be referenced in a `Jenkinsfile` using the `credentials` binding in a `withCredentials` block.
   - Example in a `Jenkinsfile`:
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
         agent any
         stages {
             stage('Example') {
                 steps {
                     withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-cred-id', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD')]) {
                         // Use USERNAME and PASSWORD variables within this block
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

2. **In Job Configurations**:
   - Credentials can also be used within traditional Freestyle project job configurations.
   - When configuring build steps or post-build actions, select the credentials from a dropdown list where applicable.

3. **As Environment Variables**:
   - In both Freestyle and Pipeline jobs, the credentials can be injected into the build as environment variables, which can then be used by the build scripts or tools being executed.

4. **Via Plugins**:
   - Some Jenkins plugins are designed to work with credentials and provide their mechanisms for securely passing credentials parameters to build or deployment tools.

The main conceptual point to understand is that credentials should be considered sensitive data and handled securely through Jenkins' built-in credential storage mechanisms. This approach allows for credentials to be used throughout Jenkins jobs without storing them plaintext in source control or exposing them to users without appropriate access permissions.
